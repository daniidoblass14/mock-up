# AutoLytix – UI/UX Principles

- White space is good.
- Fewer buttons > many buttons.
- Clear primary action per screen.
- Icons only when they add meaning.
- Mobile experience is priority.
- Forms must feel light, not heavy.
- Every screen should answer: "What can I do here?"

Avoid:
- Overloaded dashboards
- Dark patterns
- Complex tables on mobile
